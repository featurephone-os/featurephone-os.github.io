BREW is an operating system by Qualcomm. Brew MP uses its own RTOS kernel, earlier versions used [REX]({% post_url 2023-05-10-rex-os %}) kernel for that matter. It's used in CDMA phones made by various vendors, including Kyocera, Sharp, and LG. The amount of customization by vendors varies.

It ships its own eponymous application runtime, based on native code. Some versions have a J2ME runtime as well.
